# Precaching

Workbox excels in providing a seamless precaching experience, allowing developers to ensure that their web application's critical resources are stored locally before they are actually needed.

<mark style="color:green;">**This feature is enabled by default!**</mark> All assets managed by Asset Mapper are cached.

Hereafter the main benefits of Precache:

* **Faster Load Times**: Since assets are stored locally, web applications can load faster, providing a better user experience.
* **Offline Support**: Precached assets ensure that the application is usable even without a network connection.
* **Consistency**: All users receive the same version of files, ensuring a consistent experience.
* **Background Updates**: Assets are updated in the background, preventing any interruption to the user experience.

By leveraging Workbox for precaching, developers can build more resilient and user-friendly web applications that perform reliably under various network conditions.
