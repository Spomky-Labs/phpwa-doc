# Service Worker Creation

The bundle provides a simple console command to create a very basic Service Worker:

```sh
symfony console pwa:create:sw
```

This will create the file `sw.js` in your `assets` folder. This file will contain only placeholders that will be populated depending on the features described after.

If you want to remove one feature or the other, you can remove the associated placeholder.
