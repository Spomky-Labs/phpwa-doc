# Workbox

This bundle provides a simple Workbox integration path. Service Workers are not that easy to write. It can become a nightmare when dealing with mutliple caching rules or offline capabilities.&#x20;

Workbox takes the pain out of service worker creation by providing a set of tools and best practices that can be used out of the box. Itâ€™s like having an expert by your side, guiding you through the complexities of browser caching and service worker logic.

## Key Features

* **Precaching**: Workbox can precache the assets in your web app and keep them up to date.
* **Runtime Caching**: Flexible strategies for handling runtime requests, such as stale-while-revalidate, cache first, and network first.
* **Request Routing**: Easily define how different types of requests are handled by your service worker.
* **Background Sync**: Integrate background sync to replay failed requests once connectivity is restored.
* **Offline Fallback**: allow your service worker to serve a web page, image, or font if there's a routing error for any of the three, for instance if a user is offline and there isn't a cache hit.
