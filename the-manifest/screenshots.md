Progressive Web App screenshots enable richer installation UI. As shown below, by default only the application name and short name are visible.

However, by including screenshots in the web app manifest, the installation experience can be significantly improved. These screenshots give users a visual preview of the app, enhancing their understanding and increasing the likelihood of installation.

Screenshots should showcase the most important functionalities of your application and be of high quality to attract users.

In the example below, a selection of screenshots are visible and the user can navigate to show them all. On mobile devices, the interface is different, but shows the same information.
