# How To Install/Remove A PWA?

For a Progressive Web App (PWA) to be installable, the Manifest file must include certain mandatory information that are listed [on this page](the-manifest/application-information/).

{% hint style="info" %}
The PWA is not really installed. Your system will not download all the pages, assets, source code of your application and will not start a web server. The "installation" can be compared to a fully featured link to a web page, including application detail, icons or any other information defined in the manifest file. The browser will also "plus" application feautres to the host system.
{% endhint %}

To add or remove a Progressive Web App (PWA) from your browser, follow these general steps. Please note that the exact steps may vary slightly depending on the browser and version you are using.

## Adding a PWA

### **Chrome**

When navigating on a Progressive Web App, an icon will be visible on the right side of the URL toolbar. Clicking on it will open a dialog with the application detail and a button to install it.

This will create a shortcut on your desktop or in the app menu, and the PWA will open in a separate window.

Below an example on [www.github.com](https://github.com).
