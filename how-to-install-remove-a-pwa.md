# How To Install/Remove A PWA?

For a Progressive Web App (PWA) to be installable, the Manifest file must include certain mandatory information that are listed [on this page](the-manifest/application-information.md).

To add or remove a Progressive Web App (PWA) from your browser, follow these general steps. Please note that the exact steps may vary slightly depending on the browser and version you are using.

## Adding a PWA:

### **Chrome:**

When navigating on a Progressive Web App, an icon will be visible on the right side of the URL toolbar. Clicking on it will open a dialog with the application detail and a button to install it.



This will create a shortcut on your desktop or in the app menu, and the PWA will open in a separate window.

**Microsoft Edge:**

1. Navigate to the website you want to install as a PWA.
2. Click on the three-dot menu icon in the top-right corner.
3. Select "Apps."
4. Click on "Install this site as an app."

The PWA will now be installed and accessible from your Start menu or desktop.

#### Removing a PWA:

**Chrome:**

1. Open the PWA you want to remove.
2. Right-click on its shortcut in the app menu or desktop.
3. Select "Uninstall."

**Microsoft Edge:**

1. Open the Start menu or desktop shortcut for the PWA.
2. Right-click on the app icon.
3. Choose "Uninstall."

These steps should help you add or remove a PWA from your browser, but keep in mind that the exact process might differ slightly based on updates and changes made to browsers over time.
