# How To Install/Remove A PWA?

For a Progressive Web App (PWA) to be installable, the Manifest file must include certain mandatory information that are listed [on this page](the-manifest/application-information.md).

To add or remove a Progressive Web App (PWA) from your browser, follow these general steps. Please note that the exact steps may vary slightly depending on the browser and version you are using.

## Adding a PWA

### **Chrome**

When navigating on a Progressive Web App, an icon will be visible on the right side of the URL toolbar. Clicking on it will open a dialog with the application detail and a button to install it.

This will create a shortcut on your desktop or in the app menu, and the PWA will open in a separate window.

Below an example on [www.github.com](https://github.com).

The installation of a PWA is very similar to Chrome.
